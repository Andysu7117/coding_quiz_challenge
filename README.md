# coding_quiz_challenge

## Description
This project is a timed quiz. The languages used to code this quiz were HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These languages were used as they are the ones in which i am currently learning. The parts I struggled with in this project were:
-Getting the quiz to move onto the next question when an answer was selected
-Saving Scores to the leaderboard
A feature I would like to implement in the future is having the leaderboard in descending order with the highest score at the top and adding a limit to how many names are on the leaderboard.

## Installations
The project can be accessed through the following URL: https://andysu7117.github.io/coding_quiz_challenge/

The landing page should look like this screenshot:

## How to use
To start the quiz you just have to press the start quiz button on the screen. Once you have completed the quiz an initials will pop up for you to enter your initials.
